# Best vs Rest:
# Give n top moves the same combined priority for search as the rest of the moves.
# N can be defined through:
# - setting n to a fixed value
# - setting some threshold to seperate the nth from the n+1th value
#       - want this to be very low when n ~ 5, so that we rarely have more than 5 candidates
